### **Assignment 2: Market Risk**  
- **Objective**:  
  Analyze the risk of a market index, specifically **BSE Power**, by constructing the **Markowitz Market Portfolio** and identifying the **minimum variance portfolio**.  
- **Analysis**:  
  - Calculated the portfolio's risk-return profile.  
  - Constructed the efficient frontier and plotted the **indifference curve** to visualize risk-return preferences.  
- **Tools Used**:  
  - **Python**: NumPy for matrix calculations, Matplotlib for plotting.  
  - **Approach**:  
    - Selected the **BSE Power** index as the market index.  
    - Applied **Markowitz portfolio theory** to identify the minimum variance portfolio.  
    - Plotted the **efficient frontier** to show optimal portfolio compositions.
